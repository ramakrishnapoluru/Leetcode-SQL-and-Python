<pre><strong>Input:</strong>
Loans table:
+---------+---------+-----------+
| loan_id | user_id | loan_type |
+---------+---------+-----------+
| 683     | 101     | Mortgage  |
| 218     | 101     | AutoLoan  |
| 802     | 101     | Inschool  |
| 593     | 102     | Mortgage  |
| 138     | 102     | Refinance |
| 294     | 102     | Inschool  |
| 308     | 103     | Refinance |
| 389     | 104     | Mortgage  |
+---------+---------+-----------+
<strong>Output</strong>
+---------+
| user_id | 
+---------+
| 102     | 
+---------+
<strong>Explanation</strong>
- User_id 101 has three loan types, one of which is a Mortgage. However, this user does not have any loan type categorized as Refinance, so user_id 101 won't be considered.
- User_id 102 possesses three loan types: one for Mortgage and one for Refinance. Hence, user_id 102 will be included in the result.
- User_id 103 has a loan type of Refinance but lacks a Mortgage loan type, so user_id 103 won't be considered.
- User_id 104 has a Mortgage loan type but doesn't have a Refinance loan type, thus, user_id 104 won't be considered.
Output table is ordered by user_id in ascending order.
